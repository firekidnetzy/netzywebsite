        <u><h3>QUOTES HEARD FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES</h3></u>
        <p>Don't stop when it hurts, stop when you are done.</p>
        <p>Life is like a book—some chapters are happy, some are sad, but all are needed to make it meaningful.</p>
        <p>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift—that’s why it is called the present.</p>
        <p>A 6-year-old girl asked her 16-year-old brother, "What is love?" He replied, "I know you take my chocolate from my bag, but I still keep it there every day."</p>
        <p>Being fearless isn't bravery—it’s the ability to go through your fear.</p>
        <p>Some situations are like a chessboard—you can't win without taking a step.</p>
        <p>The wrong people come to teach you the right lessons.</p>
        <p>Love is patience; no matter what, you have to wait and let the universe do its magic.</p>
